Solar System Model
============
This model is showing how does the Solar system work. There is the Sun itself, the Moon and such planets as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, as well as lots of stars in the model. In order to keep the real ratio in the distances between the Sun and planets some of them are not represented. Model planets are moving faster or slower relating to the Earth just like the real ones.
As well, there is the time counter that show how many years and days passed after launching the model.

The model is made on the `html5` `canvas` just using `javascript`.
All the planets and stars are the objects having their own properties. Each object is an instance of the special `class` SpaceObject. Such approach lets us easily make any number of planets or stars whatever we want.

To launch the model you need just to open `index.html` in your browser.
